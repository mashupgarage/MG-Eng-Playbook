# Javascript Competencies

## Functional Programming

### Description

Applies concepts from functional programming when writing JS code.

### Examples

- Understands the benefits of immutability.
- Writes pure functions.

## Variables

### Description

Declares variables in a way that minimizes reassignment.

### Examples

- Uses `const` as default way to declare variables.
- Avoids use of `let` unless absolutely necessary.

## Array/Object manipulation

### Description

Manipulates arrays and objects in a way that minimizes unwanted mutations.

### Examples

- Uses functional style iterators (e.g `.map`, `.reduce`, `.filter`) instead of loops (e.g. `for`, `while`).
- Has a commanding grasp of the splat (`...`).
- Prefers immutable versions of operations (e.g. `.slice` instead of `.pop`).
