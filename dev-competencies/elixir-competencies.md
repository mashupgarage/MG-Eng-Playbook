# Elixir Competencies

## Functional Programming

### Description
Developers should have a solid understanding of functional programming concepts such as immutability, recursion, higher-order functions, pattern matching, and immutable data structures.

## Examples

- Able to use pattern match effectively.
- Understands how immutable and mutable data works.
- Able to loop using recursion and high level functions.


## Syntax and Core library Familiarity

### Description

Developers should be comfortable with Elixir syntax, data types (atoms, tuples, lists, maps), modules, functions, and core libraries. Understanding how to leverage built-in functions and modules effectively is essential for writing idiomatic Elixir code.

## Examples

- Able to define public and private methods (def/defp).
- Able to use pattern match effectively.
- Knows built in function and its usage such Enum and String function.

## Concurrent Programming

### Description
Elixir leverages the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM), which excels at concurrency and distribution. Developers should be proficient in working with concurrent processes (OTP, supervisors etc).

### Examples

- Be able to setup a concurrent module that utilizes the built-in functions like spawn, send and receive.

## Elixir tooling

### Description
Elixir specially the Phoenix framework comes with varierty of tools including the Mix build tool, Hex package manager, and IEx interactive shell. Understand the usage of these tools is crucial for effective development.

### Examples

- Understands how build tools are used.
- Manage libraries with hex package manager.
- Be able to interact with IEx shell.

## Ecto and Database Interactions

### Description
Ecto is the database library for Elixir, providing a powerful query interface and schema abstraction. Developers should be proficient in defining schemas, writing queries, performing CRUD operations, and managing database migrations using Ecto.

### Examples

- Be able to interpret queries using Ecto.
- Can define schemas.
- Manage database migrations.

## MVC framework

### Description
Developers should be skilled in building web applications with Phoenix, structuring applications using MVC architecture, handling HTTP requests, and implementing server-side and client-side logic.

### Examples

- Understanding on how model-view-controller works.
- Be able to develop an app using the said architecture.

## Testing

### Description
Developers should be adept at writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. These can be done using the built-in ExUnit testing framework in Phoenix.

### Examples

- Able to write unit tests
