# Development
These are the preferred tools we use for developing software

## [Github]()
- We use this to track the version history of a project
	- Each project has a repository that contains all the code contributed by developers
	- Projects are released in versions which can be viewed and accessed in their respective repositories
- We also use this as a collaboration tool
	- Devs create Pull Requests (PRs) that detail the changes they're adding to a project
	- Devs do code reviews and communicate their comments through these PRs

## [Vim]()
- Developers are free to use whatever editor they want but we recommend at least basic knowledge of vim
- We recommend vim when working in a terminal based environment (e.g. SSH)
