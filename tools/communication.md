# Communication

These are the preferred tools we use for communication within the company:

## Slack
- We use this to share knowledge
	- We have a *slackoverflow* channel to share or ask questions from other developers.
	- We also have dedicated channels for discussing specific tech (e.g. elixir, ruby, react, docker)
- We use this for project communications
	- There are dedicated channels for project specific discussions
	- We can notify other devs when a pull request is up for review
	- We send out announcements to the teams through these channels
- We also add integrations with services
	- We use integrations with github to get notified of updates (e.g. comments, merges, new PRs) more easily
	- We use integrations with bug tracking applications (e.g. bugsnag) to get notified of bugs faster

## Discord
- We use this for some team meetings such as:
	- Daily stand ups;
	- Sprint planning; and
	- Project post mortems
- We use this for pair programming sessions
	- Whenever devs are struggling and they need help they can conduct their pair programming sessions on our discord server
- We sometimes host online events on our discord server such as:
	- Teaching sessions;
	- Code challenges; and
	- Hangouts
