# Communication

These are the preferred tools we use for communication within the company:

## [Slack]()
- For sharing information
	- We have channels where you could share and receive information from not just your team.
	- *slackoverflow* channel is a good programming exchange that we utilize for when we want to share or ask questions from other developers.
- For sending out PRs (pull requests)
	- We use the project channel in slack to send ping the team that a pull request is for review
- For team announcements
	- We send out announcements to the teams via the project channel. Announcements range from asking for PR reviews to implementing things in the project that would affect the team.
- For integrations with services
	- We use integrations with github to get notified of updates (e.g. comments, merges, new PRs) more easily
	- We use integrations with bug tracking applications (e.g. bugsnag) to get notified of bugs faster

## [Discord]()
- For team calls
	- We do our daily stand ups using discord.
	- We also conduct our sprint planning with discord.
	- Project post mortems are done via discord.
- For pair programming sessions
	- Whenever devs are struggling and they need help they conduct their pair programming sessions on our discord server
