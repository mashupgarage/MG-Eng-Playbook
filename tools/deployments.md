## Gigalixir

Gigalixir is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to deploy and run their Elixir and Phoenix web applications. It is built on top of the Google Cloud Platform and provides a number of features to make it easy to deploy, run, and scale Elixir and Phoenix applications.

Some of the features of Gigalixir include:

- Automatic scaling and load balancing: Allows applications to automatically scale up or down in response to changes in traffic.
- Automatic zero-downtime deployments: Allows developers to deploy new versions of their applications without any interruption to service.
- Automatic backups: Regularly backs up your data to ensure data is safe and can be restored easily.
- Custom domains and SSL certificates: Allows you to use your own domain name and SSL certificates for your applications.
- Erlang/OTP and Elixir version management: Allows you to manage the version of Erlang and Elixir runtime that your application runs on.
- Real-time monitoring and logging: Allows you to monitor the performance of your application and troubleshoot issues.
- Add-ons: Allows you to add various services such as databases, caches, and more.
  Gigalixir is designed specifically for Elixir and Phoenix web applications, which makes it an ideal choice for developers who are building these types of applications. It's also a good option for teams that want a simple and easy-to-use PaaS that is built on top of a reliable and scalable cloud infrastructure.

## AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of remote computing services (also called web services) that make up a cloud computing platform, offered by Amazon.com. These services operate from 12 geographical regions across the world. They provide a variety of services such as storage, networking, database, application services, analytics, and more. These services can be used together or individually, and can be accessed over the internet. AWS also offers a variety of tools to help manage and monitor usage of these services.

Below are some of the services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS):

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - A service that allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications.

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) - A scalable, high-speed, web-based storage service.

- Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) - A managed service for relational databases such as MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server

- Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) - A container orchestration service

## Docker

Docker is a platform that enables developers to easily create, deploy and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that include all the necessary dependencies and libraries for an application to run. This makes it easy to move applications between different environments, such as from a developer's laptop to a production server, without having to worry about compatibility issues.

Docker provides a containerization technology that enables developers to package their applications and dependencies together in a portable container, that can run consistently across different environments.

Docker also provides tools for managing and orchestrating containers, making it easy to scale and manage large numbers of containers. This allows for efficient use of resources, and consistency in deployment.
Docker has a large ecosystem, with a lot of community support, and a wide range of tools and services that integrate with it.

## Semaphore

Semaphore CI is a cloud-based continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform. It allows developers to build, test, and deploy their code changes automatically and quickly. The platform is designed to work seamlessly with GitHub and GitLab, and it supports multiple programming languages and frameworks. Some of the features of Semaphore CI include:

- Automated build and test pipeline: Allows developers to set up a series of commands that will run automatically each time code is pushed to a repository.

- Parallel testing: Allows developers to run multiple tests simultaneously, which can speed up the testing process.

- Deployment pipeline: Allows developers to automatically deploy code changes to different environments, such as staging or production.

- Real-time monitoring and analytics: Provides detailed information about the performance of builds and tests, which can help developers identify and fix issues quickly.

- Customizable workflows: Allows developers to customize the pipeline to fit their specific needs.

- Collaboration tools: Allows developers to share and discuss code changes with their team members.

Semaphore CI is a popular choice for teams that need a powerful and customizable CI/CD platform, and it is especially useful for teams that are using GitHub or GitLab for version control.
