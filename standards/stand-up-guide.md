# Stand Up/Stand Down Guide

A stand up meeting (shortened to stand up) is a communication tool used to keep the team up to date with what's happening in a project. Usually it is held as an online meeting but most projects go for an asynchronous version that uses a form submission instead. It's important to fill this up daily to maintain good visibility to team mates, project managers and clients. To make it most effective, here are some guidelines we follow along with examples:

## Categorize your tasks

As much as possible, make sure to list down everything work related you did for the day. These can fall into categories like the following:

### TICKET
Anything directly related to working on tickets including development, paring, and testing. You can use the ticket name or describe the task. It also helps to put a url that links directly to the ticket.
- ✅ (TICKET) Started working on admin sees new dashboard design (example.com/ticket-001)
- ✅ (TICKET) Done with admin sees read receipts for emails (example.com/ticket-002)
- ✅ (TICKET) (WIP) Investigate missing invoices from Xero (example.com/ticket-003)

## Indicate progress of tasks

When tasks span more than a day or are done in installments add some states that give indication of the progress of your tasks. A task can be in one of the following states:

### Started
