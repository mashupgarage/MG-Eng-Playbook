# Error Handling

An application with zero errors does not exist. No matter how well written, it's inevitable that it would run into errors at some point. Hence, the most we can do is be prepared to handle these issues such that they don't bring down the application and can be addressed ASAP. These are some principles we follow to handle errors effectively.
