Testing React code has a bit of learning curve and can be confusing at times. This is a collection of practices and techniques we adopted through our years of experience working with React JS.

## Test the application like how a user would

## Apply dependency injection

## Write your components with accessibility in mind

## Add visible loading states

## Use react-select-event to test react-select elements
