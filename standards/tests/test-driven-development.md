# Test-Driven Development

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development technique where developers write automated tests before writing any code.

## Why TDD approach?

One of the primary benefits of TDD is that it helps developers catch errors early on in the development process. By writing tests first, developers can identify any issues with their code before it is implemented. This reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs into the system and helps ensure that the code is of high quality from the outset.

## Benefits on writing tests

It encourages developers to think about the requirements of the code before writing it. This helps ensure that the code meets the needs of the project and avoids unnecessary or extraneous features. By focusing on the requirements first, developers can create code that is both efficient and effective.

## \*Disadvantage

One of the main objections to TDD is that it can be time-consuming. Writing tests before writing code can seem like an unnecessary step that adds time to the development process. \*However, studies have shown that the time saved in debugging and fixing errors more than makes up for the time spent writing tests.

## The Mashup Garage way

Here in Mashup Garage, we actually do not solely follow TDD. However, we encourage everyone to write a test on every module/feature you worked on. This makes it easier to maintain the code in the future, which can save time and money in the long run.
