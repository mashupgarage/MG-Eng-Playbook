## Keep it Small
- Ideally PRs should be not more than 700 additions/deletions
- If PR grows beyond that consider asking if ticket needs to be split into smaller ones
- If a big PR for a single feature is unavoidable consider branching out and splitting parts of the feature (e.g. backend, frontend, tests) into smaller PRs

## Provide a Detailed Description
- Provide answers to these questions:
	- What did the PR accomplish?
	- How did it accomplish that?
	- Why was it accomplished as such? (if applicable) Are there limitations or special conditions for the approach?
- Sometimes it's better to over communicate than under communicate

## Provide screenshots or screen capture
- Do only if applicable. It might not be needed for backend changes for example
- Add a short description of what happened for each screenshot
- Use a gif when you need to show a series of interactions
- For bugfix tickets, consider putting a before and after section
- Show desktop, tablet, or mobile views when applicable
