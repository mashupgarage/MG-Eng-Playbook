# Code of Conduct

## Developer Values

### Open Communication
- We strive for an environment where developers are open to discuss and learn from each other
- We encourage sharing of ideas and new discoveries
### Collaboration
- We encourage developers to give each other feedback and review each otherâ€™s work
- We encourage leads to know when to delegate tasks so that other developers can grow from working on these tasks
- We build a culture where each developer owns their work and hold themselves accountable for anything related to it
### Quality of Work
- We strive to maintain good quality of work and encourage best practices
- We believe quality work has these characteristics, in this order:
	- It should work;
	- It should be fast; and
	- It should be readable
- We encourage writing testable code for appropriate testing suites
### Adaptability
- We encourage developers to step out of their comfort zone or specialization (e.g. front end developer, back end developer) and gain an understanding of each part of the development process
- We embrace curiosity and a continuous passion to learn and adapt to new technologies
### Work-Life Balance
- We try to find the right priorities to get work done according to schedule
