# Code of Conduct

## Developer Values

### Open Communication
- We strive for an environment where developers are open to discuss and learn from each other
	- Ask for help when stuck on task for at least 1 hour
	- As much as possible be online and contactable
- We encourage sharing of ideas and new discoveries
	- Share your discoveries in the appropriate channels (e.g. Slack, Discord, etc)
### Collaboration
- We encourage developers to give each other feedback and review each otherâ€™s work
	- Comment and suggest improvements when applicable
	- Ask questions and be open to learn different approaches
- We encourage leads to delegate tasks, when applicable, so that other developers have opportunity to grow
	- Do pair programming when possible
	- Share and teach your techniques with others
- We build a culture where each developer owns their work and hold themselves accountable for anything related to it
	- Be open to comments and suggestions
	- Help others out when there is something you're more familiar with
### Quality of Work
- We strive to maintain good quality of work and encourage best practices
	- Document your process and share it with others
- We believe quality work has these characteristics, in this order:
	- It should work;
	- It should be fast; and
	- It should be readable
- We encourage writing testable code for appropriate testing suites
	- Always write tests and cover as much of the codebase as possible
	- Learn best practices to make code easier to test
### Adaptability
- We encourage developers to step out of their comfort zone or specialization
	- Don't lock yourself into one area (e.g. front end only, back end only)
	- Learn at least the basics of each part of the development process
- We embrace curiosity and a continuous passion to learn and adapt to new technologies
	- Be open to work on tasks outside specialization and ask experts for advice
### Work-Life Balance
- We try to find the right priorities to get work done according to schedule
	- Don't overwork yourself
	- Communicate blockers in a timely manner
